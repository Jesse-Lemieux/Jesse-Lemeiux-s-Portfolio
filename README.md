# Jesse-Lemeiux-s-Portfolio

## welcome to the readme of my portfolio!

  To accomplish this look, I first made a general layout in html. I then added images to the apropriate sections. Then I started wrapping most images and sections in many containers, knowing I was going to use a ton of flexbox, I knew I would need them. Then i begainn orienting the page using CSS, moving most things into line by tinkering with flex box. Once everything was where i needed it, i started adding the text labels to the hero and run buddy images. I used an absolute postion to achieve this. Finally i added media queries to the CSS and made sure everything looked okay for all screen sizes.
